# compvar
HCP neural variability project.

CompVar stands for 'comparing variance'.

The computational variance project compares measures of neural variability in the time, spectral, and information-theoretic domains to standard measures of neural activity. To do this, it uses resting-state MEG and fMRI data collected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).
